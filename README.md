# ze-delivery-challenge-trainning
This is the z√©-delivery [challenge](https://github.com/ZXVentures/ze-code-challenges/blob/master/backend.md) that I did only for trainning purposes. To do this I used express framework and MongoDB as the database, with mongoose. As I did only to train the REST API and logics concepts, it is not finished. It still misses some validations and tests.
